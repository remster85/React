See it live on [codepen](https://codepen.io/remster85/pen/jYdEKE?editors=1000).

If you have extra time or want to practice your new skills, here are some ideas for improvements you could make, listed in order of increasing difficulty:  

- Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.  
- Bold the currently selected item in the move list.  
- Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.  
- When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
